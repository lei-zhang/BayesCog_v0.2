This repository contains all materials (slides & codes) from my *BayesCog_v0.2* workshop. <br />
UKE, Hamburg, 2018


### What's new:
 - Unpack reinforcement learning model
 - Add details of model comparison
 - Add posterior predictive check for RL models
 - Add justification for RPE signal (in model-based fMRI)
